title: Summary of '10 conversion rate blunders'
---

This article summaries some key points from the 10 conversion rate blunders we can avoid.

First, **Don’t rely on your gut instincts, and do more test.** Sometime, we think images can lead more attention. In fact, it’s wrong. Irrelevant images bring distractions to people, which prevents them from making best decisions. Some actions, which we think is helpful, actually not. So, just do more tests. As we all know, Practice is the sole criterion for testing fact. The estimation of customers comes from our test over and over again.

Second, **Shortest is not the best, the most suitable is.** In Computer science, there is a kind of algorithm, called finding the shortest path. We always think that the shortest path save us time and effort. While, in improving conversion rate, shortest means people can’t have full understanding in product. Later, get higher bounce! So, we should find a suitable length of path for users, which can help users have a good understanding in product and have a persistent usage.

Third, **Keep it simple and stupid.** Information overload makes us exhausted,  our time and attention are limited. With too much information we want to pass to users through product,  which have many distractions. We should only give core information to users. In model selection, there is a Occam razor principle. In all possible models, the best model is which can explain the known data in a very simple way. So, keep it in mind.

Fourth, **Thinking from the users’ point of view.** Give customers what they want, not just what you want. We should know your customers’ thoughts and needs, give them what they’re interested in, which is a good communication between us and our customers.

Fifth, **Give personalized product.** People in different environment has different thoughts and habits, so showing personalized experience of product for people gives them more comfort. For example, some people think the higher discounts are better, while some think high discounts are too godd to be true. So 
one product showing 25% off discounts for all of them is not better. why? We don't meet different needs for different people. So personalized products is necessary.

Sixth, **Be consistent.** We get much information and we are scatterbrained. It’s not easy to maintain a consistent message. But if we want to improve conversions, consistency is imperative. We must implement a clear, concise step-by-step guide for the prospect to build their trust. No curve balls. No surprises.

Seventh, **Call-to-Action button be simple and fancy.** CTA button is used for directing users to do something. We must lead people more interested to click it. Remember that, write button’s content in pithy and engaging way.

That’s all. Let’s start with these suggestions.
